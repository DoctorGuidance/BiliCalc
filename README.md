# Neonatal Bilirubin Calculator

This is a web-based calculator to help medical professionals determine the appropriate action for neonatal jaundice based on the 2022 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines. The calculator uses the infant's gestational age, postnatal age in hours, and total serum bilirubin (TSB) level to provide recommendations for phototherapy or exchange transfusion.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this tool is to provide a quick and easy way to check an infant's bilirubin levels against the AAP guidelines for managing hyperbilirubinemia in newborns 35 or more weeks of gestation. It aims to reduce the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia and its neurotoxic effects, such as kernicterus.

## Setup

There is no complex setup required. The calculator is a standalone web page. To run it, simply follow these steps:

1.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the repository's root directory.
3.  Open the `calculator.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

There are no dependencies to install or build steps to run.

## How to Use

The calculator is designed to be intuitive and easy to use:

1.  **Date and Time of Birth**: Enter the infant's date and time of birth using the provided date and time pickers.
2.  **Gestational Age**: Select the infant's gestational age in weeks using the buttons provided.
3.  **Total Bilirubin Level**: Enter the infant's total serum bilirubin (TSB) level in mg/dL.
4.  **Use Custom Lab Time (Optional)**: If you want to calculate the infant's age at a specific time (e.g., when the lab sample was taken), check the "Use custom lab time" box and enter the lab date and time. Otherwise, the infant's current age will be calculated automatically.
5.  **Risk Factors**: Check the "Neurotoxicity risk factors are present" box if the infant has any risk factors as defined by the AAP guidelines (e.g., isoimmune hemolytic disease, G6PD deficiency, sepsis, significant clinical instability).
6.  **Kernicterus Signs**: Check the "Has signs of kernicterus?" box if the infant is showing signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy. This is a medical emergency.

The results, including the phototherapy and exchange transfusion thresholds, will be displayed automatically. The tool will provide a clear recommendation based on the entered data.
